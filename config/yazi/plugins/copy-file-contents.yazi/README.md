# Copy-file-contents.yazi

A simple plugin to copy file contents just from Yazi without going into editor.

## Features

- Copy one or more file contents to clipboard.
- Set custom separator for copied contents.
- It utilises yazi's `ya.clipboard()` to copy contents to clipboard, taking care of binary files too.
